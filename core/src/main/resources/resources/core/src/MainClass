/**
 * The main class of the game, constructed once in each of the platform-specific Launcher classes. Doesn't use any
 * platform-specific code.
 */
// In SquidSetup, squidlib-util is always a dependency, and squidlib (the display code that automatically includes
// libGDX) is checked by default. If you didn't change those dependencies, this class should run out of the box.
//
// If you didn't select squidib as a dependency in SquidSetup, this class will be full of errors. If you don't depend
// on LibGDX, you'll need to figure out display on your own, and the setup of multiple platform projects is probably
// useless to you. But, if you do depend on LibGDX, you can make some use of this class. You can remove any imports or
// usages of classes in the squidpony.squidgrid.gui.gdx package, remove as much of create() as you  want (some of it
// doesn't use the display classes, so you might want the dungeon generation and such, otherwise just empty out the
// whole method), remove any SquidLib-specific code in render() and resize(), and probably remove putMap entirely.

// A main game class that uses LibGDX to display, which is the default for SquidLib, needs to extend ApplicationAdapter
// or something related, like Game. Game adds features that SquidLib doesn't currently use, so ApplicationAdapter is
// perfectly fine for these uses.
