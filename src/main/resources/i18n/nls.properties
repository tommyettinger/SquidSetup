sdkVersion=Target Android API:
sdkVersionTip=Version of the targeted Android API; should be at least 29.

gradleTasksTip=The generator can optionally run Gradle tasks after your project is ready. If you include the Gradle wrapper, it will be used to execute the tasks - otherwise it is assumed that Gradle is globally installed and available through "gradle" command. You don't need to enter "gradle" or "gradlew" manually, just list the tasks. Suggested tasks:\n- lwjgl3:run - runs the desktop application, allowing you to test the project template. Change "lwjgl3" to "desktop" if you use the older LWJGL2 platform.\n- lwjgl3:jar - Liftoff uses "jar" to build runnable JAR files that can be distributed; other setup tools often call it "dist" instead, but it does the same thing.

Useful Gradle tasks:\n- lwjgl3:run - runs the desktop application, allowing you to test the project template. Change "lwjgl3" to "desktop" if you use the older LWJGL2 platform.\n- lwjgl3:jar - Liftoff uses "jar" to build runnable JAR files that can be distributed; other setup tools often call it "dist" instead, but it does the same thing.\n- gwt:superDev - compiles GWT application and allows you to debug it at localhost:8080/index.html\n\n[GREEN]SETUP COMPLETE[WHITE]
